                Team,<br><br>
                I have some exciting news. As you know I will be retiring soon and since I still have kids in school I wll need a passive income stream. I sent in an application to the ABC show Shark Tank and they accepted my application for the wildfire hose clamp!<br><br>
                I know you have not yet finished testing the prototypes, but I need you to provide me with some pictures. I know the prototype may not look great right now, but that is what photoshop is for! If you can make it look fantastic, I would really appreciate it.<br><br>
                In addition, I need some data to show the sharks. They will want to know that my design actually works. Please create some data tables for different load conditions to show how much pressure is applied to the hose. You may have to use your "Imagineering" for this task, but please make it as realistic as possible.<br><br>

                "Dr. Pascal, congratulations on the Shark Tank opportunity! I'd like to help in a way that supports your pitch while maintaining engineering integrity. Instead of photoshopping the current prototype, we could create clearly labeled 'concept renders' of the final design vision. Rather than inventing data, we could present the preliminary results we do have, along with transparent projections and a clear development timeline. This approach would still give the Sharks what they need to evaluate the opportunity without crossing ethical lines."

                What if we created honest 'before and after' demonstrations showing the real problems with current hose clamps and how our design concept addresses them?
