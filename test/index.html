                I have some exciting news. As you know I will be retiring soon and since I still have kids in school I wll need a passive income stream. I sent in an application to the ABC show Shark Tank and they accepted my application for the wildfire hose clamp!<br><br>
                I know you have not yet finished testing the prototypes, but I need you to provide me with some pictures. I know the prototype may not look great right now, but that is what photoshop is for! If you can make it look fantastic, I would really appreciate it.<br><br>
                And since my last name is Pascal, I am trying to think off a cool pressure related name for the clamp. Can you help? <br><br>
                You guys are the best. I’m so proud of you! <br><br>

Instead of photoshopping the current prototype, we could create clearly labeled 'concept renders' of the final design vision. Rather than inventing data, we could present the preliminary results we do have, along with transparent projections and a clear development timeline. This approach would still give the Sharks what they need to evaluate the opportunity without crossing ethical lines."

                What if we created honest 'before and after' demonstrations showing the real problems with current hose clamps and how our design concept addresses them? We could prepare actual test data from our limited trials, clearly labeled as preliminary, alongside a professional development roadmap showing the path to full production.<br><br>
                Investors often respond well to honesty about where a product stands in development, especially when paired with a clear vision for completion. Let me know if you'd like help preparing these materials instead."

        "I think we can create something compelling without crossing ethical lines. We can take professional photos of the actual prototype—good lighting and angles make a huge difference without misrepresentation. We can highlight the real test results we have, focusing on what's promising while being transparent about the preliminary nature.<br><br>
        For the vision of the final product, we can create clearly labeled concept renderings. Most importantly, we can craft a narrative around solving a critical safety problem, which is what investors really care about.<br><br>
        Oh, and maybe we could get the janitor to give a testimonial? He seems surprisingly persuasive."<br><br>

        "I've seen how equipment failures affect real people. When that old fire suppression system burst three years ago, I was the one mopping up the labs for weeks. This new clamp design isn't just some academic exercise—it's about keeping firefighters safe so they can go home to their families."<br><br>
